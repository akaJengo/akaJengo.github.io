            <h2>Paint Number Guesser</h2>
            <p>Developed by one of my students under my supervision. Created an AI that would read the
                pixel values on the screen and predict the number written. Using the MNIST training set 
                we trained a feedforward neural network with backpropagation using Keras. The trained model
                was exported and implemented into the paint program.

            <h2>Niagara Museum App</h2>
            <p>The frontend lead, oranized a team of students in building a Niagara Museum Association app using React and React Native,  
                in order to allow access to virtual tours. Created modals, buttons, login screen, text and basic navigation around the app. 
                Implemented the React Native codebase to work on various mobile applications such as IOS and Android including respective styling. 
                Worked in an agile environment with regular scum meetings utilizing Jira to track and update backlogs.

            <h2>Milk Runner</h2>
            <p>This project is an IOS/Android app using React Native this aims to save time on delivery drivers such as Uber, Skip, Pharma and 
                Grocers. Implemented Dijkstra search heap to find the optimal path between delivery locations, where the max search is limited to 
                10 000 locations in a worst case of O(E + V log V) running time, where edges and vertices are defined respectively.

            <h2>Traffic Simulator</h2>
            <p>This project is a simulation game that simulates a driving environment using graphs to represent 
                roads and intersections. Players control a vehcile and attept to manuver their vheicle around busy 
                streets filled with npc cars, busses, and other vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Implemented various Java Design patterns such as model view controller, factory, 
                singleton, composite and used XML/XSD to verify the structure of the data and parse elements.

            <h2>Genetic Programming Breast Cancer Regression</h2>
            <p>This project is able to extrapolate information if a given person has a malignant or benign tumor based on 30 parameters. 
                Using genetic programming this project was able to identify cancerous tumours in over 20k+ patients. 
                Futhermore, testing out of sample data proved to be accurate within 98%.

            <h2>Open AI SlimeVolley</h2>
            <p>SlimeVolley Gym is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that uses proximal policy optimization. 
                PPO falls into the actor-critic family of reinforcement learning. Using Stable-Baselines 3, the project
                was able to use PPO to train the slime (our slime is yellow).

            <h2>Chess AI</h2>
            <p>This project uses Alpha Beta pruning where it can Min/Max each board possibility and move
                between the player and the AI. It begins by viewing the entire board and assesing each piece 
                and its value (weight). It then creates a new state and makes a move, based on the move it makes
                the AI calculate the heuristic function. Once the AI has gone down to its depth (~14) it then 
                begins walking the path, it walks down the path where it is the best for the AI and the worst 
                for the player (Min-Max). Then proceeds to make that move.
